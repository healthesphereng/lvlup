Create a sleek and intuitive web app called 'Lvl Up' that gamifies personal growth by tracking daily tasks and rewarding users with an experience (EXP) system. The app should have a UI inspired by Opay, emphasizing simplicity, smooth navigation, and a card-based design.

ðŸŒŸ Core Features:
Dashboard: Displays the userâ€™s current level, EXP progress, and recent activities in a visually engaging format.
Task System: Users can add tasks, categorize them (Health, Productivity, Learning, etc.), and earn or lose EXP based on completion. Implement a streak system for consistency rewards.
Challenges: Mini-goals with milestone rewards to keep users engaged.
Leveling System: Uses an exponential EXP formula where each level requires more points to progress, preventing too-fast leveling. Implement a Prestige Mode where users can reset their level after reaching a cap, gaining special perks.
Milestone Rewards: Unlockable badges, motivational quotes, or exclusive features upon reaching key levels (e.g., Level 5, Level 10).
Leaderboards & Social Integration: Users can compare progress globally or with friends, fostering friendly competition.
Customization: Users can tweak task EXP values, themes, and notifications.
